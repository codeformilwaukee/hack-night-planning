# Changes Made After Retrospectives

1. For July 2019, we brought additional supplies (such as dry erase markers and name tags), and are starting to enforce more structure as to how the event is conducted. We also offered orientation for new members.
2. For August 2019, we will be paring down the introduction presentation to only include core components and leave the rest to orientation. We are moving the UWM location to Bolton Hall, where better collaboration space exists. We also will ask all attendees to move to one of the rooms (hacking or orientation room) after the introduction and speaker presentation are finished as the general meeting room is more cramped and to get people to become involved.
3. For September 2019, we will continue with the strict room assignments. Orientation should take place during the networking session instead of during hacking, to ensure continuity. Erin will facilitate creating a feedback form to file opinions, disagreements, etc. on anything we are instituting for the group
